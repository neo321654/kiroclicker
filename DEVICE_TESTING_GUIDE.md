3. Check that all UI elements are responsive

#### Image Selection Test
1. Tap "Select Image" or camera icon
2. Choose an image from gallery OR take a screenshot
3. Verify the selected image appears in the interface
4. Test with different image formats (PNG, JPG)

**Expected Results:**
- Image selection should work smoothly
- Selected images should display correctly
- App should handle various image formats

#### Coordinate Setting Test
1. With an image selected, tap on the image to set click coordinates
2. Verify a marker appears at the tapped location
3. Try tapping different locations to update coordinates
4. Check that coordinates are displayed numerically

**Expected Results:**
- Tap detection should be accurate
- Visual marker should appear at tap location
- Coordinates should update correctly

#### Parameter Configuration Test
1. Set interval between clicks (test various values: 100ms, 1000ms, 5000ms)
2. Set repeat count (test: 1, 10, infinite mode)
3. Verify input validation (try invalid values like negative numbers)

**Expected Results:**
- Valid values should be accepted
- Invalid values should show error messages
- UI should prevent invalid configurations

### 2. Auto-Click Functionality Test

#### Prerequisites
- Accessibility service must be enabled
- Valid configuration (image + coordinates + parameters) must be set

#### Basic Auto-Click Test
1. Configure a simple auto-click setup
2. Tap "Play" or start button
3. Observe the auto-click behavior
4. Tap "Stop" to halt the process

**Expected Results:**
- Auto-click should start when accessibility service is enabled
- Clicks should occur at specified intervals
- Process should stop immediately when requested

#### Image Recognition Test
1. Create a configuration with a distinctive image pattern
2. Navigate to a screen containing that pattern
3. Start auto-click and observe behavior
4. Test with the pattern in different screen locations

**Expected Results:**
- App should find the pattern when visible
- Clicks should occur at the correct relative position
- App should handle pattern not found gracefully

### 3. Edge Cases and Error Handling

#### Accessibility Service Disabled Test
1. Disable the AutoClicker accessibility service in system settings
2. Try to start auto-click in the app
3. Verify appropriate error message and guidance

**Expected Results:**
- App should detect disabled service
- Clear error message should be shown
- App should provide guidance to enable service

#### Invalid Configuration Test
1. Try to start auto-click without selecting an image
2. Try to start without setting coordinates
3. Test with extremely small intervals (< 100ms)

**Expected Results:**
- App should prevent starting with invalid configuration
- Clear error messages should explain what's missing
- App should not crash or become unresponsive

#### Memory and Performance Test
1. Run auto-click for extended periods (10+ minutes)
2. Monitor device performance and battery usage
3. Test with complex images and high-frequency clicking

**Expected Results:**
- App should remain responsive during extended use
- Memory usage should not grow excessively
- Device should not overheat or become sluggish

### 4. Configuration Management Test

#### Save Configuration Test
1. Create a complete configuration
2. Save it with a descriptive name
3. Verify it appears in the saved configurations list

#### Load Configuration Test
1. Select a saved configuration from the list
2. Verify all parameters are loaded correctly
3. Test that the loaded configuration works as expected

#### Delete Configuration Test
1. Delete a saved configuration
2. Verify it's removed from the list
3. Confirm deletion doesn't affect other configurations

**Expected Results:**
- Save/load operations should preserve all configuration data
- Configuration list should update correctly
- Deletion should work without affecting other data

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Accessibility Service Issues
**Problem:** Auto-click doesn't work
**Solutions:**
1. Verify accessibility service is enabled in system settings
2. Restart the app after enabling the service
3. Check device compatibility (API 28+)
4. Reboot device if service seems stuck

### Image Recognition Issues
**Problem:** Pattern not found when it should be
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure image quality is good (not blurry or too small)
2. Try adjusting the confidence threshold
3. Test with simpler, more distinctive patterns
4. Verify the pattern is actually visible on screen

### Performance Issues
**Problem:** App is slow or unresponsive
**Solutions:**
1. Close other apps to free memory
2. Use smaller, simpler images when possible
3. Increase click intervals to reduce processing load
4. Restart the app if it becomes sluggish

### Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Saved configurations don't work
**Solutions:**
1. Verify image files still exist and are accessible
2. Check that coordinates are still valid for the image
3. Ensure parameters are within valid ranges
4. Try recreating the configuration if corruption is suspected
